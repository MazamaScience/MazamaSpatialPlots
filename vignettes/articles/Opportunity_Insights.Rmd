## Objective

The goal of this document is to illustrate how **MazamaSpatialPlots** can be used
to easily recreate state or county level choropleth maps found on the web.

Throughout this document, we will be using data provided by 
[Opportunity Insights](https://opportunityinsights.org/); specifically, the data
used on their [Economic Tracker](https://www.tracktherecovery.org/) web app.

## Obtaining Data

All of the data we will use is easily obtainable from the Oportunity Insights 
[GitHub repository](https://github.com/OpportunityInsights/EconomicTracker). We
can use `read.csv()` to load data directly.

```{r loadData}
# COVID data by US county
URL <- "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/OpportunityInsights/EconomicTracker/main/data/COVID%20-%20County%20-%20Daily.csv"
countyCovid <- read.csv(URL, stringsAsFactors = FALSE)
names(countyCovid)
head(countyCovid)
```

## Map 1: COVID Cases in Washington Counties

The first map we will recreate is the map of new cases in Washington state 
(by county). We define new cases to be a 7-day rolling average of confirmed
cases of COVID-19 per 100k residents.

```{r map1_basic, warning = FALSE}
# column 'new_case_rate' is the confirmed covid cases per 100k residents, 7-day rolling average
countyCovid_formatted <- countyCovid %>%
  mutate(
    date = lubridate::parse_date_time(paste(year, month, day), "y m d", tz = "UTC"),
    countyFIPS = stringr::str_pad(countyfips, width = 5, pad = "0"),
    stateCode = US_stateFIPSToCode(substr(countyFIPS, 0, 2)),
    new_case_rate = as.numeric(new_case_rate)) %>%
  filter(date == lubridate::today() - lubridate::days(3)) %>%
  group_by(countyFIPS) %>% 
  mutate(meanCaseRate = mean(new_case_rate, na.rm = TRUE)) %>%
  select(countyFIPS, stateCode, meanCaseRate)

countyMap(
  data = countyCovid_formatted,
  parameter = "meanCaseRate",
  stateCode = "WA",
  breaks = seq(0, 200, 10),
  palette = "YlOrRd",
  stateBorderColor = "white"
)
```
